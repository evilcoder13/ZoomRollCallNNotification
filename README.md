This system is used to notify when a user in monitorlist.txt joined or left Zoom meeting.


To use this, one must setup an app and point the hook API to the application receiver head.


The notification is through pushover ($5 / device), you can change the destination at will.


This is made for my wife job which required monitor some persons joins and leaves Zoom Meeting.


I don't have time to write a proper guide, so use as you like and contact me if any question.


Regards
